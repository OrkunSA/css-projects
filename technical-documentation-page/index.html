          <p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.</p>
          <p>
            It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in
            different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to
            test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such
            as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view
            library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large
            ecosystem of addons available.

            Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux
            logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and
            functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app.
            Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies
            most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to
            write Redux applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            RTK includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases,
            including store setup, creating reducers and writing immutable
            update logic, and even creating entire "slices" of state at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're a brand new Redux user setting up your first project,
            or an experienced user who wants to simplify an existing
            application, Redux Toolkit can help you make your Redux code better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Redux Toolkit is available as a package on NPM for use with a module
            bundler or in a Node application:
          </p>
          <code>
            # NPM
            <br />
            npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
            <br />
            # Yarn
            <br />
            yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Core_concepts">
      <header>Core Concepts</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Imagine your app’s state is described as a plain object. For example,
          the state of a todo app might look like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          { todos: [{ text: 'Eat food', completed: true }, { text: 'Exercise',
          completed: false }], visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED' }
        </code>
        <p>
          This object is like a “model” except that there are no setters. This
          is so that different parts of the code can’t change the state
          arbitrarily, causing hard-to-reproduce bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action. An
          action is a plain JavaScript object (notice how we don’t introduce any
          magic?) that describes what happened. Here are a few example actions:
        </p>
        <code>
          { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' } { type:
          'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 } { type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter:
          'SHOW_ALL' }
        </code>
        <p>
          Enforcing that every change is described as an action lets us have a
          clear understanding of what’s going on in the app. If something
          changed, we know why it changed. Actions are like breadcrumbs of what
          has happened. Finally, to tie state and actions together, we write a
          function called a reducer. Again, nothing magical about it—it’s just a
          function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the
          next state of the app. It would be hard to write such a function for a
          big app, so we write smaller functions managing parts of the state:
        </p>
        <code>
          function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) { if
          (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') { return action.filter }
          else { return state } } function todos(state = [], action) { switch
          (action.type) { case 'ADD_TODO': return state.concat([{ text:
          action.text, completed: false }]) case 'TOGGLE_TODO': return
          state.map((todo, index) => action.index === index ? { text: todo.text,
          completed: !todo.completed } : todo ) default: return state } }
        </code>
        <p>
          And we write another reducer that manages the complete state of our
          app by calling those two reducers for the corresponding state keys:
        </p>
        <code>
          function todoApp(state = {}, action) { return { todos:
          todos(state.todos, action), visibilityFilter:
          visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action) } }
        </code>
        <p>
          This is basically the whole idea of Redux. Note that we haven’t used
          any Redux APIs. It comes with a few utilities to facilitate this
          pattern, but the main idea is that you describe how your state is
          updated over time in response to action objects, and 90% of the code
          you write is just plain JavaScript, with no use of Redux itself, its
          APIs, or any magic.

          The Redux docs are intended to teach the basic concepts of Redux, as
          well as explain key concepts for use in real-world applications.
          However, the docs can't cover everything. Happily, there are many
          other great resources available for learning Redux. We encourage you
          to check them out. Many of them cover topics that are beyond the scope
          of the docs, or describe the same topics in other ways that may work
          better for your learning style.

        <p>
          This page includes our recommendations for some of the best external
          resources available to learn Redux. For an additional extensive list

          Redux is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully
          chosen to spawn an ecosystem of tools and extensions, and the
          community has created a wide variety of helpful addons, libraries, and
          tools. You don't need to use any of these addons to use Redux, but
          they can help make it easier to implement features and solve problems
          in your application.

        <h2>When should I learn Redux?</h2>
        <p>
          What to learn can be an overwhelming question for a JavaScript
          developer. It helps to narrow the range of options by learning one
          thing at a time and focusing on problems you find in your work. Redux
          is a pattern for managing application state. If you do not have
          problems with state management, you might find the benefits of Redux
          harder to understand. Some UI libraries (like React) have their own
          state management system. If you are using one of these libraries,
          especially if you are just learning to use them, we encourage you to
          learn the capabilities of that built-in system first. It might be all
          you need to build your application. If your application becomes so
          complex that you are confused about where state is stored or how state
          changes, then it is a good time to learn Redux.
        </p>
        <h2>When should I use Redux?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Not all apps need Redux. It's important to understand the kind of
            application you're building, the kinds of problems that you need to
            solve, and what tools can best solve the problems you're facing.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Redux helps you deal with shared state management, but like any tool,
          it has tradeoffs. It's not designed to be the shortest or fastest way
          to write code. It's intended to help answer the question "When did a
          certain slice of state change, and where did the data come from?",
          with predictable behavior. There are more concepts to learn, and more
          code to write. It also adds some indirection to your code, and asks
          you to follow certain restrictions. It's a trade-off between short
          term and long term productivity.
        </p>
        <h2>Can Redux only be used with React?</h2>
        <p>
          Redux can be used as a data store for any UI layer. The most common
          usage is with React and React Native, but there are bindings available
          for Angular, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, and more. Redux simply provides
          a subscription mechanism which can be used by any other code. That
          said, it is most useful when combined with a declarative view
          implementation that can infer the UI updates from the state changes,
          such as React or one of the similar libraries available.
        </p>
        <h2>Do I need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?</h2>
        <p>
          Redux is originally written in ES6 and transpiled for production into
          ES5 with Webpack and Babel. You should be able to use it regardless of
          your JavaScript build process. Redux also offers a UMD build that can
          be used directly without any build process at all. The
          <a
            href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter-vanilla"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >counter-vanilla</a
          >
          example demonstrates basic ES5 usage with Redux included as a
          <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
          tag. As the relevant pull request says:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The new Counter Vanilla example is aimed to dispel the myth that
            Redux requires Webpack, React, hot reloading, sagas, action
            creators, constants, Babel, npm, CSS modules, decorators, fluent
            Latin, an Egghead subscription, a PhD, or an Exceeds Expectations
            O.W.L. level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nope, it's just HTML, some artisanal
            <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, and plain old DOM manipulation.
            Enjoy!
